# X (Twitter) Media Upload Implementation

This directory contains the updated X API media upload implementation that follows the latest X API best practices and documentation.

## Overview

The implementation has been updated to use the latest X API v2 endpoints and follows the recommended patterns for media uploads, including:

- Proper chunked upload for videos
- Exponential backoff for status checking
- Better error handling and logging
- Rate limiting considerations for free tier usage

## Files

### Core Implementation
- `post-image.ts` - Handles image uploads to X
- `post-video.ts` - Handles video uploads to X
- `media-upload.ts` - Shared utilities for media upload operations

### Key Features

#### Image Upload
- Supports multiple images per post
- Single-chunk upload (images are typically small enough)
- Proper status checking after upload
- Error handling for failed uploads

#### Video Upload
- Chunked upload for videos larger than 5MB
- 1MB chunk size (recommended by X API)
- Rate limiting with delays between chunks
- Comprehensive status checking with exponential backoff
- Support for various video formats

#### Shared Utilities
- `initializeMediaUpload()` - Initialize media upload session
- `appendMediaData()` - Upload single chunk (for images)
- `appendMediaChunk()` - Upload individual chunks (for videos)
- `uploadMediaInChunks()` - Handle multi-chunk uploads
- `finalizeMediaUpload()` - Complete the upload process
- `checkMediaStatus()` - Monitor processing status with exponential backoff

## API Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Chunked Upload
- Videos are uploaded in 1MB chunks as recommended by X API
- Proper segment indexing for multi-chunk uploads
- Delays between chunks to avoid rate limiting

### 2. Status Checking
- Exponential backoff algorithm (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max)
- Maximum 30 attempts (configurable)
- Proper error handling for failed processing
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 3. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages with HTTP status codes
- Graceful handling of network failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Proper cleanup on failures

### 4. Rate Limiting
- 200ms delays between video chunks (increased for free tier)
- Exponential backoff for status checks
- Respectful of X API rate limits

## Free Tier Considerations

The implementation is optimized for free tier usage:

- Increased delays between operations to avoid rate limiting
- Comprehensive error handling for quota limits
- Detailed logging for debugging issues
- Graceful degradation when limits are reached

## Usage

The implementation is automatically used by the social media posting system when:

1. A post contains images → `postImage()` is called
2. A post contains a video → `postVideo()` is called

Both functions handle the complete upload process including:
- Media initialization
- Data upload (single or chunked)
- Finalization
- Status checking
- Tweet creation with media

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Network failures
- API rate limits
- Invalid media formats
- Processing failures
- Timeout scenarios

All errors are logged with detailed information for debugging.

## Logging

The implementation includes detailed logging for:

- Upload initialization
- Chunk uploads (for videos)
- Status checks
- Success/failure states
- Error details

This helps with debugging and monitoring upload performance.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:

1. **Retry Logic**: Implement automatic retries for transient failures
2. **Progress Tracking**: Add progress callbacks for long uploads
3. **Format Validation**: Pre-validate media formats before upload
4. **Size Optimization**: Automatic resizing for oversized media
5. **Caching**: Cache media IDs for reuse when possible
