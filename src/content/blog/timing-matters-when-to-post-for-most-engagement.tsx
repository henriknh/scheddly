      <p>
        There is no universal &quot;best time,&quot; but there are reliable
        windows when audiences are more active. Use them as a starting point,
        then adjust to your own results.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Reliable starting windows</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Weekdays: 8—10am and 4—6pm local time</li>
        <li>Weekends: 9—11am local time</li>
        <li>Avoid late nights unless your audience skews nocturnal</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Make timing work for you</h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Pick two primary windows and schedule consistently for 3—4 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>Track leading signals: saves, shares, and early comments.</li>
        <li>Iterate your schedule by +/− 30 minutes based on engagement.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">How Scheddly helps</h2>
